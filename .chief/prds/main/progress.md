## Codebase Patterns
- Tailwind v4 with `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (no tailwind.config.js, use CSS-based config in `resources/css/app.css`)
- Dark mode via `class` strategy: `@variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));` in CSS
- Dark mode composable at `resources/js/Composables/useDarkMode.js` — uses localStorage
- `AppLayout.vue` is the main app layout (mobile-first, dark mode); `AuthenticatedLayout.vue` is Breeze's updated layout
- PWA via `vite-plugin-pwa` configured in `vite.config.js`
- App name is "RReader" (set in `.env` and PWA manifest)
- `@vitejs/plugin-vue` v6 required for Vite 7 compatibility
- Breeze Vue scaffolding provides auth pages under `resources/js/Pages/Auth/`
- Use `slate-950` for backgrounds, `slate-900` for cards/surfaces, `slate-800` for borders, `blue-500` for primary accent
- Use `text-base` on form inputs for mobile (prevents iOS auto-zoom on focus)
- Use `focus:ring-offset-slate-900` on dark backgrounds for proper focus ring visibility
- Breeze components default to light theme — always replace gray/indigo with slate/blue palette
- Database is SQLite with foreign keys enabled
- Use `text()` for URL columns in migrations (URLs can exceed 255 chars)
- `foreignId()->constrained()` already creates an index — don't add redundant `$table->index()` on FK columns
- Use composite indexes for boolean filters (e.g. `['user_id', 'is_read']` not just `'is_read'`)
- `laminas/laminas-feed` for RSS/Atom parsing — `FeedReader::importString($xml)` to parse feed content
- Services go in `app/Services/` — inject via controller method parameters (Laravel auto-resolves)
- Feed-related routes: `feeds.create` (GET), `feeds.preview` (POST), `feeds.store` (POST)
- Use `Http::timeout(15)->withUserAgent('RReader/1.0')` for external HTTP requests

## 2026-02-17 - US-001
- What was implemented: Project scaffolding with Laravel 11 + Inertia.js + Vue 3, Tailwind CSS v4 with dark mode (class strategy), PWA manifest and service worker via vite-plugin-pwa, base AppLayout component with mobile-first responsive design and dark mode toggle
- Files changed:
  - `composer.json` / `package.json` — project dependencies
  - `vite.config.js` — Vite config with Laravel, Vue, Tailwind v4, and PWA plugins
  - `resources/css/app.css` — Tailwind v4 CSS config with dark mode variant
  - `resources/js/app.js` — Inertia app setup with service worker registration
  - `resources/views/app.blade.php` — Blade template with PWA meta tags, dark class on html
  - `resources/js/Layouts/AppLayout.vue` — New mobile-first dark mode layout
  - `resources/js/Layouts/AuthenticatedLayout.vue` — Updated Breeze layout for dark mode
  - `resources/js/Layouts/GuestLayout.vue` — Updated Breeze guest layout for dark mode
  - `resources/js/Composables/useDarkMode.js` — Dark mode composable with localStorage persistence
  - `resources/js/Pages/Dashboard.vue` — Updated to use AppLayout
  - `public/icons/` — PWA icons (192x192, 512x512)
  - `.env` / `.env.example` — APP_NAME set to RReader
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Breeze scaffolds Tailwind v3 config even when `@tailwindcss/vite` v4 is in package.json — must delete `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` and use CSS-based config
  - `@vitejs/plugin-vue@5` is incompatible with Vite 7, need v6
  - `imagefilledroundedrectangle()` doesn't exist in all PHP GD versions — use `imagefilledrectangle()` instead
  - The `postcss` and `autoprefixer` packages in package.json are not needed with Tailwind v4 vite plugin but were left to avoid breaking anything

- What was implemented: Dark-themed, mobile-first authentication pages (Login, Register, Forgot Password, Verify Email, Confirm Password). Updated all Breeze UI components (TextInput, PrimaryButton, InputLabel, InputError, Checkbox) for dark theme with proper slate/blue color scheme. Replaced default Laravel Welcome page with minimal RReader landing page. All auth flows work with proper dark styling, large touch targets, and full-width buttons.
- Files changed:
  - `resources/js/Components/TextInput.vue` — Dark bg/border/text colors (slate-800/700/100), blue focus ring
  - `resources/js/Components/PrimaryButton.vue` — Blue-600 bg, py-3 for larger touch target, justify-center
  - `resources/js/Components/InputLabel.vue` — text-slate-300 for dark readability
  - `resources/js/Components/InputError.vue` — text-red-400 for dark contrast
  - `resources/js/Components/Checkbox.vue` — Dark bg/border, blue-500 check color
  - `resources/js/Pages/Auth/Login.vue` — Full-width button, dark link colors, "Create an account" link, text-base inputs
  - `resources/js/Pages/Auth/Register.vue` — Full-width button, dark link colors, centered "Already registered?" link
  - `resources/js/Pages/Auth/ForgotPassword.vue` — Dark text colors (slate-400, green-400)
  - `resources/js/Pages/Auth/ConfirmPassword.vue` — Dark text colors
  - `resources/js/Pages/Auth/VerifyEmail.vue` — Dark text/link colors, blue focus rings
  - `resources/js/Pages/Welcome.vue` — Replaced Laravel default with minimal RReader landing (logo, login/register buttons)
  - `routes/web.php` — Removed unused Application import and version props
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Breeze components use light-theme colors by default (gray-300, gray-600, gray-700, indigo-500) — must replace all with dark palette (slate-700, slate-400, slate-300, blue-500)
  - Use `text-base` on inputs for mobile to prevent iOS auto-zoom on focus (16px minimum)
  - Use `focus:ring-offset-slate-900` on dark backgrounds so focus rings look correct
  - GuestLayout was already dark-themed from US-001, so auth pages just needed component and page-level color fixes

## 2026-02-17 - US-003
- What was implemented: Core database schema and Eloquent models for categories, feeds, articles, and user_articles pivot table. All migrations with proper foreign keys, cascading deletes, and optimized indexes. Models with full relationship definitions (User hasMany Categories/Feeds, Feed belongsTo Category, Feed hasMany Articles, User belongsToMany Articles via pivot).
- Files changed:
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_17_000001_create_categories_table.php` — categories table (id, user_id FK, name, sort_order)
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_17_000002_create_feeds_table.php` — feeds table (id, user_id FK, category_id nullable FK, title, feed_url, site_url, description, favicon_url, last_fetched_at)
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_17_000003_create_articles_table.php` — articles table (id, feed_id FK, guid unique per feed, title, author, content, summary, url, image_url, published_at)
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_17_000004_create_user_articles_table.php` — user_articles pivot (user_id, article_id, is_read, is_read_later, read_at)
  - `app/Models/Category.php` — Category model with user/feeds relationships
  - `app/Models/Feed.php` — Feed model with user/category/articles relationships
  - `app/Models/Article.php` — Article model with feed/users relationships
  - `app/Models/UserArticle.php` — UserArticle pivot model with user/article relationships
  - `app/Models/User.php` — Added categories(), feeds(), articles() relationships
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `foreignId()->constrained()` automatically creates an index on the FK column — no need for additional `$table->index()`
  - Use `text()` instead of `string()` for URL columns — real-world URLs often exceed 255 characters
  - Boolean column indexes alone have near-zero selectivity — use composite indexes like `['user_id', 'is_read']`
  - SQLite handles `cascadeOnDelete()` and `nullOnDelete()` correctly with foreign keys enabled

## 2026-02-17 - US-004
- What was implemented: Feed subscription feature — users can add RSS/Atom feeds by URL with auto-discovery, preview feed details before subscribing, optionally assign categories (existing or new), and initial articles are fetched and stored on subscription.
- Files changed:
  - `app/Services/FeedParserService.php` — New service for RSS/Atom feed parsing using laminas/laminas-feed, with auto-discovery from HTML pages, URL normalization, and article extraction
  - `app/Http/Controllers/FeedController.php` — New controller with create (form), preview (discover + validate), and store (subscribe + fetch articles) actions
  - `resources/js/Pages/Feeds/Create.vue` — New Add Feed page with URL input, loading states, feed preview card, category selection (existing or new), dark-themed mobile-first design
  - `routes/web.php` — Added authenticated routes: GET /feeds/create, POST /feeds/preview, POST /feeds
  - `composer.json` — Added laminas/laminas-feed dependency for RSS/Atom parsing
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `laminas/laminas-feed` is the go-to PHP library for RSS/Atom parsing — use `FeedReader::importString()` for parsing XML content
  - Feed auto-discovery works by looking for `<link>` tags with `type="application/rss+xml"` or `application/atom+xml` in HTML pages
  - Author data from laminas-feed returns an ArrayObject — use `$entry->getAuthor()?->offsetGet('name')` to get the name string
  - Always normalize URLs by prepending `https://` if no scheme is present
  - Use `Http::timeout(15)->withUserAgent('RReader/1.0')` for external feed fetching to be a good citizen
  - Inertia's `useForm().post()` with `preserveScroll: true` keeps the page position during preview requests
